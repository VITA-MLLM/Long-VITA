## üî• News
* **`2025.02.09`** üåü We support training and inference on both Ascend NPU with Modellink and Nvidia GPU with Megatron.
* **`2025.02.05`** üåü The training code, deployment code, and model weights **have been released**. ~~We currently only support Ascend NPU and are working on adapting to Nvidia GPU~~.
* **`2024.02.05`** üåü We are proud to launch Long-VITA, a strong long-context visual language model supporting over one million tokens.

## ‚ú® Highlights

- **Long Context**. Long-VITA can process more than **4K** frames or over **1M** visual tokens. It achieves state-of-the-art performance on Video-MME under 20B models.
- **Open Source**. Long-VITA is trained on **open-source data** only, consisting of a mix of 17M samples that are publicly available.
- **Strong Performance**. Long-VITA achieves competitive results on image and video understanding benchmarks among cutting-edge models under 20B parameters.
  

## üìà Experimental Results
- **Comparison of image understanding**.
